Dear Friend,
    Thank you for being part of my life. You have been one of the most supportive people in my life and I will be forever grateful for that. I can still recall the day we befriended each other: two strangers at a bench talking about computer hardware. Since then, we have continued to grow closer as the years passed. Despite certain periods of conflict, I am thankful to have a friend not only accepting of my shortcomings and issues but also constantly helping me improve myself. You have always been available to help me, even when you were handling your own issues. I know I can be stubborn and difficult, but despite that, you have always listened and helped, providing both support and advice to deal with personal and general issues. I realize college be a parting of ways between us and I know it will make maintaining a friendship much more difficult. Despite the distance between us, know that I will always be available to listen and  help you with anything that troubles you.
Best regards,
Erik Ji
