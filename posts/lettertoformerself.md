## A Letter to My Former Self

Dear Prior Self,

Please take careful note of everything in this letter—I know you won’t if I don’t specify it now. These next four years will be brutal. Your subpar work ethic will not withstand the quantity and quality of classwork expected from you until you make changes. Your inadequacies will become more exposed and you will become more self-aware. During certain periods of the school year, you will feel like you are on a roll. That is impossible; given your mentality and work ethic, you are probably confusing that feeling with that of falling off a cliff into a pit of procrastination and suffering. Despite these challenges, you will press on. You will hit the ground running on the first day of school and come limping out on the last, ready to do it over again in just a few months. As long as you work hard, keep a good attitude, and persevere you will succeed.

Cordially,

Future Erik
