## Future Plan

Here I will briefly detail my next five years: I will be attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Engineering. I am not sure what to expect from college aside from my academic life. I hope to make new friends and gain plenty of new life skills during my time in school. During this time I also hope to take on summer internships or jobs to extend my knowledge of my field and possibly make some money. After my undergraduate studies, I intend to continue to complete a masterâ€™s degree and find a job. While I do not know where exactly I will aim to work, I am nearly certain I will try to find a job back in the Silicon Valley.
